## Hi there 👋

I'm Leni, yet another software engineer/developer 🤓

* I am comfortable working in Django and Rails backends 🖥️
* I am confident in troubleshooting anything to do with Docker and development setups 💪
* I am currently learning TypeScript, Go and React 🔍
* I’m currently working on a variety of FOSS projects. My GitHub activity should show which ones those are 😄
* I am very curious about Svelte 🕵️‍♀️
* You can sponsor my work via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/lenikadali)
